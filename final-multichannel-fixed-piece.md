## Deadline: Week 13: {{ site.week-13 }}  

The final project is a complete piece (_recommended: 8-12 minutes in duration_) for fixed media, in 8-channel surround sound, to be played back on the 8-channel system in our Spatial Audio Lab in Karstadt.  

Send your piece to me (complete project folder + exported audio files) by Week 13. I will send you some notes for revision, which will be due before our final listening session: our final class.   

<!-- The final is a complete piece (_recommended: 8-12 minutes in duration_) for fixed media, in <strike>8-channel</strike> 4-channel surround sound.  -->

<!-- This piece will be featured during the _**Werkstatt für Aktuelle Musik**_ (January 17-20, 2024).   -->

You are encouraged (but not required) to use your midterm “sketch” as a basis for your final piece.  

Of course, you can choose to treat the final as an entirely separate piece, but the option to use your midterm as a “miniature” version of your final piece is given.   

It would be an efficient use of time to expand upon the ideas you presented in your midterm, or somehow make use of the work you did there. Supplement your work with our lessons in mixing, multichannel spatialization, SPEAR, sampling, VCV Rack, and MaxMSP techniques that you will continue to learn this semester. Revise your automation, record new sounds, etc.  

By the deadline, send me a Reaper project folder (by email, WeTransfer.com, or any cloud link), and a stereo mixdown (binaural). Instructions on how to do this will be given in class.   

Your piece should meet the following criteria:  

### Criteria   

The final project should address similar criteria from the midterm, and additionally:   

* Your piece should be approximately **8-12 minutes in duration**, but of course, this **may vary** depending on your material and your compositional approach. It can be a longer excerpt, but not much shorter.  
* Prepare your final project **in a Reaper or Ableton Live session**. Any sound files you use should also be contained inside your Reaper or Ableton project folder.  
* It should be your own, original work, focusing on your manipulation of the source sounds that interest you.  
* Include **at least 4 source sound files** and/or synthesis clips.  
* Your project should include a sequence that **utilizes multiple tracks** of source audio (recommended: 8). Imagine this to be a counterpoint of sound files.    
* Your tracks should include **automation**.  
* Make extensive use of **SpatGRIS**: add **ControlGRIS** to your tracks and add automation to in order to move your sounds around the space.  
* The 8-channel space is conceived of as a **ring of 8**, meaning 8 equidistantly-spaced speakers surrounding the audience. This setup is reproduced in our Karstadt space, which we will begin having classes in soon. _You should also use this space to work on your piece_. Reserve time by contacting our HiWis.         
<!-- * _Due to new restrictions on our final concert, we will make 4-channel pieces instead of 8-channel pieces:_ The 4-channel space is conceived of as a **square**, meaning 4 speakers surrounding the audience in 4 corners of the room.    -->
* Your tracks should include a number of **plugin** devices.  
<!-- * When you use plugins, include a **list** of them: _Your mix must be transferrable and able to play on another computer._   -->
* Strive for **tonal balance in your mix**. For example, use **EQ** and **compression** to improve the interaction between the sounds in your tracks, with special attention to how the sounds change when you apply multichannel spatial movement. We will discuss these concepts further in our lessons on mixing and post-production.      
* Sound files and samples should be exported at a **sample rate of 48 kHz** and a **bit depth of 24 bits** (48 kHz / 24 bits).   

_Note that you're being given the **maximum amount of time to finish your pieces** before the final listening session. Therefore, if your piece is late, unfortunately this will result in a fail._   

<!-- _Once the piece has been soundchecked on the performance day, no further revisions or changes can be made before the performance._   -->
