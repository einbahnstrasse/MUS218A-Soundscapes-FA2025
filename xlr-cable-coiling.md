## Deadline: Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}  

Microphones and speakers are connected using [3-pin XLR cables](https://www.google.com/search?q=xlr+cable&sca_esv=571840155&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKl7SE-2oID6ZJbkkx17KCT-LoPdMQ:1696851973303&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd6OqY8uiBAxWbQ_EDHbo7CQUQ0pQJCKIJ&biw=1569&bih=939&dpr=2.2){:target="_blank"}:   

When it comes to wrapping cables (_“coiling”_ or _“rolling”_), there are some good practice habits to form.  

**Watch the video** below for instructions on how to do this properly:  

{% include video id="0yPcJD7RVuY" provider="youtube" %}

By the deadline, **email me a short video**, perhaps made with your phone, in which you properly coil a microphone cable yourself using the technique you learned in the demonstration video.  

Unfortunately, it's too easy to coil cables improperly after we build down from a performance. We all need to be skilled in this area, and we are all expected to wrap cables after our concerts, so this assignment is just a simple chance to practice.   

Let me know if you have any questions!
