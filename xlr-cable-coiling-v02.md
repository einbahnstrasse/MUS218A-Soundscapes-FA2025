# XLR Cable Coiling Assignment  

## Deadline  
**Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}**

---

## Introduction  
Microphones and speakers are connected using [3-pin XLR cables](https://www.google.com/search?q=xlr+cable&tbm=isch){:target="_blank"}.  
When it comes to wrapping cables (_“coiling”_ or _“rolling”_), there are correct and incorrect methods. Improper coiling can damage cables, create tangles, and slow down setup and teardown in live sound environments.  

This assignment will give you hands-on practice with proper cable coiling techniques used in professional audio.  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Identify** the structure and function of a standard 3-pin XLR cable.  
2. **Demonstrate** proper coiling techniques for audio cables.  
3. **Differentiate** between proper and improper cable wrapping methods.  
4. **Apply** best practices to real-world performance and recording setups.  
5. **Evaluate** their own technique by reviewing their demonstration video.  

---

## Instructions  
1. **Watch the video tutorial** below on proper cable coiling:  
   {% include video id="0yPcJD7RVuY" provider="youtube" %}  

2. **Practice** coiling an XLR microphone cable using the method shown.  

3. **Record a short video** (using your phone is fine) of yourself demonstrating proper cable coiling.  

4. **Submit** the video via email to the instructor by the deadline.  

---

## Why This Matters  
After concerts and rehearsals, all students are expected to help with teardown and equipment care. Proper cable coiling ensures that cables last longer, avoid knots, and are easy to deploy at the next event. This is a fundamental professional skill in audio practice.  

---

## Submission Requirements  
- A short video file (30–60 seconds).  
- Clearly show yourself executing the over-under cable coiling technique.  
- Email to the instructor before the Week 7 deadline.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria  
- Correct use of the over-under coiling technique.  
- Neatness and consistency of loops.  
- Proper handling of cable ends and connectors.  
- Video clarity (can the process be clearly observed?).
