## 2. Course Description    

**Soundscapes: Recording and Designing Sound** is a first-semester foundational course in electronic music and sound art, introducing students to the studio environment and to the rudiments of digital creation, recording, mixing, post production, synthesis and MIDI, computer music, and spatial audio. Central topics may change from one semester to the next as a result of its flexible structure. This semester will focus on **multichannel fixed media composition**.  

Weekly seminars are structured with an emphasis on creating, transforming, and sculpting sounds. Classes will frequently consist of software tutorials and in-class demonstrations that can quickly integrate into personal artistic projects. Students will be required to complete a number of smaller graded assignments, culminating in a final piece. Each week focuses on a new topic that builds upon work completed in the previous week. _**Students are therefore expected to attend regularly.**_ There is a **midterm exam**: a 3-minute stereo fixed media "sketch." This sketch can be expanded upon and made into the **final exam**: a 10-minute multichannel work for the concert.    

### 2.1 Course Goals      

This course will equip students with the basic protocols of working in a studio enviornment, acquainting them with the fundamnetals of acoustics and sound, digital audio, an overview of the history of techniques for analog and digital audio production and synthesis, and will provide direct, hands-on experience creating multichannel electronic music in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), as well as an inroduction to the MaxMSP real-time audio and synthesis environment. 
  
### 2.2 Learning Outcomes  

_By the end of the course, successful students will be able to do the following:_  

1. **implement** and **demonstrate** the tools of fixed media composition within an artistic workflow  
2. **classify** and **identify** a variety of synthesis methods      
3. **identify**, **critique**, and **experiment** with differing approaches to sound synthesis  
4. **compare** and **contrast** real-time and offline synthesis methodologies   
5. **assemble** favored tools into a personal creative coding practice, including a logical debugging process  

### 2.3 Required Software + Hardware    

_See the [RESOURCES TAB](/resources){:target="_blank"} for download and documentation links._  
1. personal laptop  
2. headphones  
3. external hard drive _(or cloud storage to back up your files)_  
4. Reaper  
5. Ableton Live Suite   
6. SpatGRIS    
7. MaxMSP  
8. Google Chrome or any web browser that will allow you to access our Course Website & materials   
9. various other plugins and apps listed throughout the semester   
  
## 3. Expectations   

### 3.1 General Expectations   

1. **Arrive on time** to all course sessions.  
2. Spend **1-2 additional hours a week** _(outside of class)_ on the timely completion of our lab assignments and projects.  
3. Submit assignments by the given deadlines.   
4. **Back up and organize your work REGULARLY.** _Catastrophic loss of materials is not an excuse for missed deadlines!_  

### 3.2 Weekly Preparation      

1. **Study video tutorials, slides, and other assigned materials ahead of class.** Come prepared with questions if you don't understand them.  
2. We will devote the majority of our class time to patching and creating, and therefore **we will be unable to present videos and slides in class.** Familiarize yourself with this background content beforehand so that you are not lost if we do not address it directly in our class session.   
3. Additionally, you are strongly encouraged to **consult the recommended software documentation resources**. These provide context and will deepen your understanding as you build your own systems and creative tools.  

### 3.3 Communication   

1. Weekly class sessions will be held in the 2.43 Electronic Music Studio. Questions can easily be addressed before and after, if not during, our class.   
2. MHL email accounts are our official means of communication, but we will also use Discord for additional discussion.  
3. **Requests for assistance:** Send an email, or a message on Discord. I will respond during normal working hours; requests arriving "after hours" will be answered on subsequent weekdays.  
4. Discord should be used during regular hours. Please respond during the workday as promptly as you can to inquiries from the instructor (both for email and messages sent on Discord). _Multiple successive days without a response is unacceptable._  
5. **Actively participate** in our online class discussions. **Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment,** while supporting and challenging your colleagues’ ideas.  
6. **Check Discord regularly** for group and private messages.  
7. If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about assignments, etc.), post it on Discord.  
8. Use Discord for easy communication with your colleagues as well — you can DM individuals or selected groups.  

### 3.4 Self-Guided Work  

1. All students are responsible for building each of our DAW sessions (e.g., in Reaper) and each of our pedagogical patches (e.g., in MaxMSP) **by themselves**, regardless of whether a student needs to be absent or late from any class session, for any reason. 
2. This policy fosters a habit of **personal practice** using our software and **promotes self-guided learning** and **understanding**.  
3. Students are also responsbile for producing their **own work** throughout the class, including their own builds of our pedagogical patches, DAW sessions, and sample recordings, in accordance with our [Academic Integrity Policy](#academic-integrity-policy) below.  
4. Direct copies or clones of other people's creative work are evident in the line-by-line code of the software itself, and are therefore easily traceable. 
5. Students should rely on our **seminar discussions**, **patch comments**, **office hours**, software **documentation**, **help files**, and **user forums** to actively troublehsoot and **debug** issues that are naturally expected to arise during interactions with new software. _This is how one learns best as they engage in project work._   
6. By adopting this policy, we avoid fostering a habit of **relying on others' code**: that is, constantly borrowing from colleagues or forums without learning to understand the software's underlying functionality.  
7. This policy is **not to enforce copying or mimicking**, but rather to promote **reasoning through the course materials** and adopting its utilization **as template and boiler documents**, that is, as a basis for future work, aimed at **building independence and creativity**. At its core, this policy, therefore, combats the habit of **copying code** without understanding its functioning.         
8. At first, students may **progress slowly** through this process. However, just like learning to drive a car, students will become more efficient and quicker over time as they **optimize their patching routine** and **build resourcefulness**. Through our class patches and projects, students **will learn to debug faster**, to actively seek solutions from the best resources for any given necessity, and to find resolution in an efficient, self-guided manner.   

### 3.5 Attendance + Participation Policy   

> _es besteht Anwesenheitspflicht gemäß Prüfungsverfahrensordung._ 

> _Attendance is required in accordance with the examination procedure regulations._  

_Your participation is based on attendance and your engagement in class, and will form a substantial portion of your grade._   

* German law requires that you **attend a minimum of 80% of all class sessions** in order to pass this class. 
* This means **you can miss up to 3 class sessions**.  
* However, missing a class should be avoided when possible. In a skills-building music technology course such as this one, we must ensure that you are up-to-date on our materials each week — partly because the next week will often build on the materials covered last week.  
* Missing _more than_ 3 class sessions will result in a grade reduction or possibly a failure of the course, depending on whether a student satisfies additional makeup work assigned by the instructor. In this scenario, the student completes all Max patching, assignments, projects, and any additional material assigned by the instructor to help ensure understanding or evaluation of progress. Additional materials may, in some cases, require the student to attend periodic check-in meetings with the instructor to ensure the student understands material missed in class. Failure to meet with the instructor to evaluate progress in such a circumstance will result in a grade reduction if progress is otherwise not demonstrated in the student's submitted work.  

#### 3.5.1 Prompt Arrival   

1. Students are expected to arrive promptly to all class sessions and remain engaged throughout.  
2. On-time arrivals earn you an immediate 5 points (full participation).   
3. Arrivals after 14:30 trigger the following weighted score system:

<div class="latetable">

</div>

#### 3.5.2 Absences   

##### 3.5.2.1 Procedure for Absences      

* Students are responsible for completing the same work outside of class that was assigned or completed in class.   
* If you must be absent for any reason, regardless of whether that absence is excused or unexcused, follow this **Procedure for Absences:**   

  1. Check our [Schedule](/schedule){:target="_blank"} for assignments, videos, slides, readings, etc.   
  2. Contact a classmate for **patch screenshots** and **notes** on what you missed (e.g. on Discord) _(in accordance with [3.5.2.3 Sharing Patch Screenshots (MaxMSP)](#3523-sharing-patch-screenshots-maxmsp) below)._   
  3. After these first 2 steps, contact the instructor with any additional questions.   

* **Absences/tardiness must be accompanied by documentation** and/or include advance notice with the instructor. Absences/tardiness will not impact on your grade if they are reported in advance and if they are infrequent. Absences will be excused in cases of: documentation of illness provided by a doctor's note, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (always with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events, at the discretion of the instructor.  
* Planned absences should be reported to the instructor by our Week 3 class _(see our [Schedule](/schedule){:target="_blank"} page)._   
* _A lack of communication with the instructor about planned absences will therefore be treated as **unexcused**. Be in touch early._   
* **Absences and lateness may result in a lack of understanding of our materials, which will become evident in your project and/or exam work, and therefore will result in lower exam and project scores.** 

##### 3.5.2.2 Required Check-In Meetings   

* A student absent for **a single seminar** need only follow the [Procedure for Absenses](#3521-procedure-for-absences) outlined above.  
* A student missing **2 seminars** must additionally **schedule a half-hour office hour appointment**, designated as a **Check-In Meeting**, according to instructor availability outlined in [Essential Contact Information](#1-essential-contact-information) above.  
* Check-In Meetings are necessary to ensure understanding of our course content and to plan alternative work for missed class time.  
* **Every 2 absences will require a new Check-In Meeting**.  
* <span style="color: red;">_**NOTE:** Instructor availability is limited and available on a first-come-first-serve basis. I will not always be available due to my additional teaching and other events. Availability for Check-In Meetings, therefore, **is not guaranteed!** Students must coordinate around the instructor's availability if they choose to be absent from multiple seminars. Failure to scheudle or attend the required number of Check-In Meetings is  firmly the responsibility of the student and will result in lowered participation grades for the semester._</span>  
* Students should, therefore, strive to attend all seminars, or as many as possible, in person.  

##### 3.5.2.3 Sharing Patch Screenshots (MaxMSP)   

1. In accordance with [3.4 Self-Guided Work](#34-self-guided-work) above, students should **never share their patches** (.maxpat) with one another. 
2. Rather, students should **only share screenshots** of their work. In other words, all students should build each of the pedagogical patches by themselves.   
3. See [How to take a screenshot on a Mac or PC](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laptops/features/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-mac-and-pc){:target="_blank"} for further details.

## 5. Academic Integrity Policy    

### 5.1 General Notes on Academic Integrity   

Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the university recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited at Musikhochschule Lübeck (MHL) and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. 
   
<span style="color: red;">**Instructor Note:** _Code borrowed from another source must be attributed as a comment within your own code. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with the instructor before submitting. Where applicable and where marked within our course materials, follow the provisions of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/){:target="_blank"}_</span>

### 5.2 Academic Integrity Pledge   

_By enrolling in this course, you pledge to uphold the policy on Academic Integrity described below:_  

I understand the value of personal integrity and ethical behavior in all aspects of my professional and personal life. By committing to honesty and personal responsibility, I earn the respect and trust of others. As a student at Musikhochschule Lübeck (MHL), I recognize that the value of my education is not just being able to say I am a college graduate, but it also incorporates the skills, values, and knowledge I have acquired. I thus commit myself to upholding academic integrity as an important aspect of my personal integrity and professional growth. I understand that academic integrity includes:  

1. Fully observing the rules governing exams and assignments regarding resource material, electronic aids, copying, collaborating with others, or engaging in any other behavior that subverts the purpose of the exam or assignment, and the directions of the instructor.   
2. Only turning in work that I have done myself, and not using unattributed work done by others. While working and studying with others can be an effective way to learn, submitted work will be my own.  
3. Giving full and proper credit to sources and references, and acknowledging the contributions and ideas of others, in my academic work.

## 7. Course Accommodations for Students with Disabilities    

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must contact [Inclusion at MHL](https://www.mh-luebeck.de/en/studium/inclusion/){:target="_blank"}.     

### 7.1 Counseling Center   

The Psychological Counseling Services Center supports the educational, emotional and career development of MHL students by providing opportunities for skill development, counseling and referrals that address obstacles to success. For questions and appointments, more information can be found at [Psychological Counselling](https://www.mh-luebeck.de/de/studium/beratung/psychologische-beratung/){:target="_blank"}.   

## 8. Inclusivity    

### 8.1 Name and Pronoun Usage   

This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.  

### 8.2 Inclusivity Statement    

_It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas._
