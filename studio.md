# Work Stations

## Full-Audio Support              

Some work stations in the **Bates Sound Studio**, located in room 302 of the [Olin Arts Center.](https://www.bates.edu/music/about/olin-arts-center/){:target="_blank"}, are equipped with full audio support and are available in 3 spaces:   

1. the "mainspace" iMac at the front of the studio (under the projection screen)  
2. Studio A      
3. Studio B      

They look like this:

These stations with full audio support are best used for **recording** and **mixing**. If you do not need full support or can work on headphones, please leave these stations open to those who may need them. You may be asked to move to another computer but only if necessary. Of course, if no one else is using these stations, reserve time here and make ample use of access to a high quality audio system!    

### Using Your Own Computer

As the photo shows, [download MOTU Audio Drivers](https://motu.com/en-us/download/product/313/){:target="_blank"} to your own laptop if you'd like to connect your device to the speaker system. Ensure you've downloaded and installed the driver that corresponds with your computer's operating system.    

### Help Documents  

If you're unsure how to use these work stations, consult the following resources:    

1. [Bates Sound Studio Help Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nyS0aFNc3QvlNtMQjBddnNZ-yPoDga3vsXR-17NYYYg/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, and    
2. [the MOTU 1248 Audio Interface Manual](/MUS218A-Soundscapes-FA2025/assets/docs/1248_8M_16A_Switch_User_Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

If you're unable to resolve a problem that comes up during your reserved session, **contact the instructor and studio assistant** for additional troubleshooting steps. _Note: We may likely not be reachable immediately or "on the fly."_ 

**If you run into trouble, document the steps you've taken and send us an email to report any unresolved issues before you leave the studio.**    

## Other Work Stations   

### Sound Studio Macs    

Additionally, we have 3 studio computers equipped with our studio software, located at the back of the room. 2 of them are iMacs, and the last one is a Mac Studio. You can work on these stations with headphones, but they do not have audio interfaces or monitor speakers. 

These are great stations for synthesis, spectral editing, Max patching, video, or multimedia software.       

### DMS iMac Lab       

If we are running short on space or if there are a lot of sign-outs at a time when you need a computer, you can also work on similar stations in the [Digital Media Studio iMac lab](https://www.bates.edu/digital-media/){:target="_blank"}.

# Studio Calendars   

If you are enrolled in MUS218A or other studio courses, you will receive access to the following calendars. Students use these calendars to reserve time in the **Bates Sound Studio**. 

There are **3 possible spaces** to work in: **Studio A**, **Studio B**, and the **computers located in the mainspace** (i.e., the open space where classes are taught). Students may use any of the 3 following calendars to access the Sound Studio for project work and to complete daily assignments.  

Ensure that you are properly **logged in to your Bates Google account**. If you are viewing these calendars from a personal Google account, you'll encounter an error when trying to reserve time or access the calendar. _Permission to these calendars will not be extended to personal Google accounts_.
