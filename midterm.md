## Deadline: Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}  

The midterm is a “sketch” for a fixed-media piece, which you can treat as a “preview” of your final piece as you are developing your ideas.  

Of course, you can choose to treat this as an entirely separate piece, or even abandon this material for an alternate plan for your final piece, but the option to make this a “miniature” version of your final piece is given.   

This is a chance for you to explore some of the sounds that interest you, perhaps even make your own field recordings or synthesis, and showcase your mixing and automation technique.  

By the deadline, send me a soundfile and your Reaper project folder (by email, WeTransfer.com, or any cloud link) meeting the following criteria:  

### Criteria   

* Ideally, your sketch is around **3-minutes in duration**, but of course, this **may vary** depending on your material and your compositional approach. It can be a longer excerpt, but not much shorter.  
* Prepare your sketch **in a Reaper session**. Any sound files you use should also be contained inside your Reaper project folder.  
* Sketches should be your own, original work, focusing on your manipulation of the source sounds that interest you.  
* Include **at least 2 source sound files** and/or synthesis clips.  
* Your Reaper project should include a sequence that **utilizes multiple tracks** (at least 4).  
* Your Reaper tracks should include **automation**.  
* These tracks may include any number of **plugin** devices.  
* If you use plugins, include a **list** of them: _Your mix must be transferrable and able to play on another computer._  
* Strive for **tonal balance in your mix**. For example, use **EQ** and **compression** to improve the interaction between the sounds in your tracks.   
* Sound files and samples should be exported at a **sample rate of 48 kHz** and a **bit rate of 24 bits** (48 kHz / 24 bits).   

_Note that we will not be having class during the day of the deadline._
