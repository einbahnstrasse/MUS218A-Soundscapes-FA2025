## Deadline: Week 3: {{ site.week-03 }}  

### What To Do   

Write down **a detailed list of 25 sounds** documenting what you hear by following the guidelines below.  

**Send me an email** with your list by the deadline.     

### How to Do It     

From a single listening position inside your home, sit quietly and observe the sounds around you.   

Concentrate hard, shifting your attention actively.  

Try as best as you can to **identify each sound** and **identify its “source” (where the sound comes from)** relative to your listening position. 

#### Consider the following...     

* Which sounds seem to _change over time?_  
* Which sounds are _unchanging?_     
* Which sounds have their own _internal movement?_     
* Do any of your sounds _mimic musical elements?_ Chords, arpeggios, melodies, rhythms, instruments, white noise?   
* Do any of your sounds seem to be _working together?_     
* Can you hear _distant locations?_    
* Are any of the sounds from very _large sources? Very small?_      

Feel free to make notes on any observations that answer these questions or others that interest you, but don't feel obligated to write too much!  

Identifying the first 10 sounds will be easy. After that, the next 10 will get progressively more difficult, and the last 5 will be almost impossible. Push yourself... For example, if you hear 2 cars go by, what makes each of them sound different? If it's the sound of people talking, ignore the words and describe the sound of their voices.  

### Why Do This??  

**The human brain ignores more than 80% of the sounds around us.**  

It does this in order to focus on a single task at hand.  

That means **becoming an expert listener** is all about learning to actively turn on + off this **selective perception**.

### Compare Your Observations with Cage

> "'You mean it's just sounds?!' thinking that for something to be just a sound is to be useless, whereas I love sounds, just as they are. And I have no need for them to be anything more than what they are. And I don't want them to be psychological, I don't want a sound to pretend that it's a bucket, or that it's president, or that it's in love with another sound... I just want it to be a sound." —John Cage
