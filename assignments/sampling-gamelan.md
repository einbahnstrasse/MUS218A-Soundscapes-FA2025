## Deadline  
**start of Week 4: {{ site.week-04 }}**   

---

## Introduction  
In this collaborative exercise, the class will work in teams to create a **comprehensive sample library of the Bates gamelan**. Each team will be responsible for recording a group of assigned instruments from the Bates gamelan room.  

This assignment develops skills in microphone placement, gain staging, recording, file editing, and documentation. The end result will be a **shared, well-organized sample library** that you and your classmates can use in later projects, which can be made available to future generations of Bates Sound Studio musical creators as well.

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Demonstrate** careful microphone placement and gain staging in a live room environment.  
2. **Perform** basic percussion technique on gamelan instruments by striking and damping correctly.
3. **Capture** multiple types of strikes and excitation methods across a family of gamelan instruments.  
4. **Apply** consistent editing practices so that samples start with a clear attack and end after the natural resonance fades.  
5. **Organize** files according to a strict naming convention for usability.  
6. **Collaborate** in teams to contribute to a class-wide sample library.

## Assignment Instructions  

### Step 1: Team Assignments  
- The class will be divided into **teams**, each responsible for a group of gamelan instruments (e.g., saron, bonang, kenong, gongs).  
- Each team ensures **all pitches** in their assigned group are recorded and indexed.  

### Step 2: Recording Setup  
- Use a recording kit checked out from the Bates Sound Studio.     
- Set gain to avoid clipping while preserving dynamics. Aim for peaks around **–12 to -8 dBFS**.  
- Place microphones thoughtfully, aiming for the most dry/direct sound you can capture:  
- Avoid room bleed, background noise, air duct hum and "room tone," recorder and microphone handling noise, etc.  

### Step 3: Required Recordings  
For **each pitch** of each instrument:  
- Record multiple **dynamic levels** (pp, mf, ff).  
- Record multiple **note lengths** (short damped, sustained until resonance fades).  
- Record different **excitation methods** (mallet types, muted vs. open, scrapes or rolls).  
- Photograph and index the instruments and mallets or excitors that you use, which will be included with the sample library.   
    
### Step 4: Editing  
- Import recordings into Reaper.  
- **Trim** so that the file begins exactly at the attack.  
- **Short fade out** after the resonance has fully decayed.  
- Apply only minimal processing if necessary (e.g., only noise reduction if assigned), preserving the natural sound.  
- Export each sample as **WAV, 48 kHz / 24-bit**.  

### Step 5: Naming Convention  
All files must follow this structure:  

`instrument-playingMode-note-dynamics-optionalOthers.wav`   

- **instrument** = instrument name (e.g., `saron`, `bonang`, `kenong`)  
- **playingMode** = type of strike / excitation (e.g., `open`, `muted`, `roll`, `scrape`)  
- **note** = pitch (e.g., `E4`, `A3`)  
- **dynamics** = dynamic marking (`pp`, `mf`, `ff`)  
- **optionalOthers** = optional extra descriptor (e.g., mallet type, room, initials)  

**Examples:**  
- `saron-open-C4-mf.wav`  
- `bonang-muted-G3-ff.wav`  
- `largeGong1-roll-B2-pp-hardMallet.wav`  

By adhering strictly to this convention, we can write software that automatically detects and organizes our samples according to the file's metadata. Ensure the dash character `-` is only used to separate these metadata fields and appears nowhere else in the file name.     

### Step 6: Submission  
- Create a folder for each instrument your team sampled, and put all samples and photos relating to that instrument inside this folder.  
- Place your team’s files in a folder labeled: `TeamName_Instrument`.  
- Submit to the shared class drive by the deadline.  
- All teams’ files will be consolidated into a **master class sample library**.  

### Step 7: (Optional) Try Sampler   

Load any of your samples into the Reaper sampler to test their usability. Experiment with transfomring the sounds using sampler paramters.
