## Deadline  
**Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}**

---

## Introduction  
Microphones and speakers are connected using [3-pin XLR cables](https://www.google.com/search?q=xlr+cable&tbm=isch){:target="_blank"}. When it comes to wrapping cables (_“coiling”_ or _“rolling”_), there are correct, incorrect, and preferred methods. Improper coiling can damage cables, create tangles, and slow down setup and teardown in live sound environments, or during paid studio time, where every minute counts!     

This short assignment will give you hands-on practice with proper cable coiling techniques used in professional audio settings.  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:  
1. **Demonstrate** proper coiling techniques for audio cables.  
2. **Differentiate** between proper and improper cable wrapping methods.  
3. **Apply** best practices to real-world live sound and recording studio setups.  
4. **Evaluate** their own technique by reviewing their own demonstration video.  

---

## Instructions  
1. **Watch this short video tutorial** below on proper cable coiling:  
   {% include video id="0yPcJD7RVuY" provider="youtube" %}  

2. **Practice** coiling an XLR microphone cable using the method shown. Use the hanging XLR cables inside the Bates Sound Studio.  

3. **Record a short video of yourself**, using your phone, demonstrating proper cable coiling technique. If you don't have access to a phone or if it does not record video, ask a friend or ask the studio assistant during their working hours.   

4. **Submit** your video on Lyceum by the deadline, or by emailing it to the instructor. Alternatively, contact the instructor to demonstrate your coiling technique in-person during any available office hours (by the deadline).

## Why This Matters  
After concerts and rehearsals, potentially including our upcoming concert on December 2, 2025, studio and live sound personnel are expected to assist with teardown and equipment care. Proper cable coiling ensures that our cables last longer, avoid knots, and are easily reusable at the next event. Make this a habit for the benefit of your community — it helps everybody out to have well-cared for and reliable gear. _Protip: This is a fundamental professional skill to have in the professional audio space._  

---

## Submission Requirements  
- A short video file (30–60 seconds).   
- Must be you and nobody else (duh).  
- Clearly show yourself executing the over-under cable coiling technique.  
- Use only an XLR or TRS cable. Other cables have a different structure and do not coil the same way.    
- Email your video to the instructor before the deadline.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria  
- Correct use of the over-under coiling technique.  
- Neatness and consistency of loops.  
- Proper handling of the specified type of cable.  
- Video clarity — can the process be clearly observed?
